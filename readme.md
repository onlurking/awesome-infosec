Knowledge of programming is also necessary, and knowledge of python is very helpful.

  * [Introduction to Software Exploits (Exploits 1)](http://opensecuritytraining.info/Exploits1.html) <br>
Software vulnerabilities are flaws in program logic that can be leveraged by an attacker to execute arbitrary code on a target system. This class will cover both the identification of software vulnerabilities and the techniques attackers use to exploit them. In addition, current techniques that attempt to remediate the threat of software vulnerability exploitation will be discussed.

  * [Exploits 2: Exploitation in the Windows Environment](http://opensecuritytraining.info/Exploits2.html) <br>
This course covers the exploitation of stack corruption vulnerabilities in the Windows environment. Stack overflows are programming flaws that often times allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of a vulnerable program. There are many nuances involved with exploiting these vulnerabilities in Windows. Window's exploit mitigations such as DEP, ASLR, SafeSEH, and SEHOP, makes leveraging these programming bugs more difficult, but not impossible. The course highlights the features and weaknesses of many the exploit mitigation techniques deployed in Windows operating systems. Also covered are labs that describe the process of finding bugs in Windows applications with mutation based fuzzing, and then developing exploits that target those bugs.

  * [Rootkits: What they are, and how to find them](http://opensecuritytraining.info/Rootkits.html) <br>
Rootkits are a class of malware which are dedicated to hiding the attacker's presence on a compromised system. This class will focus on understanding how rootkits work, and what tools can be used to help find them. This will be a very hands-on class where we talk about specific techniques which rootkits use, and then do labs where we show how a proof of concept rootkit is able to hide things from a defender.

  * [The Adventures of a Keystroke: An in-depth look into keylogging on Windows](http://opensecuritytraining.info/Keylogging.html) <br>
Windows is designed to be compatible with a lot of devices which is why there are a lot of layers in the keystroke handling. The more layers a system has, the more probable it could be compromised by bad guys. There are more than 30 methods for capturing keystrokes from a Windows PC. Methods vary from simple user mode techniques to advanced ones such as IRP hooking. Class currently covers most of the user mode and kernel mode techniques including the undocumented ones which are not described anywhere else but there are still techniques which are not covered in the class such as Raw Input Devices. As for the hardware, we only cover PS/2 keyboards for the moment but documenting USB keyboards is one of the planned topics for near future.

Academic Courses
================

#### Florida State University's - Offensive Computer Security
The primary incentive for an attacker to exploit a vulnerability, or series of vulnerabilities is to achieve a return on an investment (his/her time usually). This return need not be strictly monetary, an attacker may be interested in obtaining access to data, identities, or some other commodity that is valuable to them.  The field of penetration testing involves authorized auditing and exploitation of systems to assess actual system security in order to protect against attackers.  This requires thorough knowledge of vulnerabilities and how to exploit them.  Thus, this course provides an introductory but comprehensive coverage of the fundamental methodologies, skills, legal issues, and tools used in white hat penetration testing and secure system administration.

#### Syracuse University's SEED
##### Developing Instructional Laboratories for Computer SEcurity EDucation
People learn from mistakes. In security education, we study mistakes that lead to software vulnerabilities. Studying mistakes from the past not only help students understand why systems are vulnerable, why a "seemly-benign" mistake can turn into a disaster, and why many security mechanisms are needed. More importantly, it also helps students learn the common patterns of vulnerabilities, so they can avoid making similar mistakes in the future. Moreover, using vulnerabilities as case studies, students can learn the principles of secure design, secure programming, and security testing.

Capture the Flag
================

#### Vulnhub
We all learn in different ways: in a group, by yourself, reading books, watching/listening to other people, making notes or things out for yourself. Learning the basics & understanding them is essential; this knowledge can be enforced by then putting it into practice.

Over the years people have been creating these resources and a lot of time has been put into them, creating 'hidden gems' of training material. However, unless you know of them, its hard to discover them.

So VulnHub was born to cover as many as possible, creating a catalogue of 'stuff' that is (legally) 'breakable, hackable & exploitable' - allowing you to learn in a safe environment and practise 'stuff' out.
When something is added to VulnHub's database it will be indexed as best as possible, to try and give you the best match possible for what you're wishing to learn or experiment with.

#### A Graduate Course in Applied Cryptography - Dan Boneh & Victor Shoup
This book is about constructing practical cruptosystems for which we can argue security under plausible assumptions. The book covers many constructions for different tasks in cryptography. For each task we define the required goal. To analyze the constructions, we develop a unified framework for doing cryptographic proofs. A reader who masters this framework will capable of applying it to new constructions that may not be covered in this book. We describe common mistakes to avoid as well as attacks on real-world systems that illustratre the importance of rigor in cryptography. We end every chapter with a fund application that applies the ideas in the chapter in some unexpected way.
